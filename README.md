# WP Headwind

A base WordPress theme using TailwindCSS. Under construction.

### Building JS/CSS

To work on js, css, and other assets you'll need to run `npm install`, then run `npm start` during development and `npm build` for production mode. The built assets will be in dist/. When in development mode the browsersync config file bs-config.js will be generated which you can configure locally for your own needs.
